# Quant_Finance_Projects

This repository contains my projects in quantitative finance, specifically for pricing models.

- Black-Scholes Pricing: uses a clever formula that has changed the markets, assuming perfectly efficient market.

- Binomial Option Pricing: Captures the market movements as binomial, move up or down, and this approaches the Black-Scholes model with timesteps approaching infinite

*See how in the binomial option file, the price of a put option approaches the one calculated from Black-Scholes
