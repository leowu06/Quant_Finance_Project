# Finance and Derivatives

This repository contains a collection of projects in **Portfolio Analysis, Strategy Backtesting** and **Options Greeks Simulation**. These were coded through Python, so I included **README** files in each folder with screenshots of each functionality and visual graphs, so the reader can interpret the purpose.

Furthermore, I have made a 3-tab **Streamlit app** that allows the user to interact with the input and simulation parameters (Options): [App (Streamlit UI)](OptionGreeksSimulator/README.md).

## ([Portfolio Analysis & Simulation](https://github.com/leowu06/Quant_Finance_Project/tree/1e122639db5233b4c7780bbd1587d137db01a67f/Portfolio%20Analysis%20%26%20Simulation)).
For the main file "PortfolioSimulationMonteCarlo" I simulated **21 years of investing** in [QQQ, MSCI, GLD, VOO] 40â‚¬ a month with an initial 1600â‚¬ vs **saving 40â‚¬ in cash a month**
- **Assets:** QQQ, MSCI, GLD, VOO.
- Simulates with **Monte Carlo**. Included a overlap percentage of these select tickers and a final 'worst-case' scenario of Î± **Value at Risk (VaR)**, and **Conditional VaR (CVaR)**.

## Backtesting Strategies

Tested trading strategies with historical data on 'GOOGL' using the `backtesting.py` framework. For example:

- **`MomentumTrendStrat`**:
  Combines RSI with trend filters (stacked moving averages: Price > MA10 > MA20 > MA50 > MA100). Entered position only when both momentum and trend aligned. Exits when below the 10-day MA.

- **`BBMeanReversion`**:
  Uses Bollinger Bands based on mean-reverting behaviour of stock price. It buys when price bounces above the lower band, sells when it comes down from the upper band.

Each strategy includes parameter optimisation and visualisation of performance metrics.

## ðŸ’¸ Pricing Models

Models for option pricing and risk â€” e.g., Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo, and binomial trees.

- **`BinomialOptionPricing`**: Implements a multi-period binomial tree model for option valuation.
- **`BlackScholesPricing`**: Implements the closed-form Black-Scholes-Merton formula for pricing European options.
